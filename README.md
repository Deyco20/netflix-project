I made too many changes to my page design, the most relevant and took me a long time to solve was the reason why I could not use tailwind in my project, I did many tests, I tried to use yarn, nothing worked, my last option was to use an online editor as a sandbox, but in the end I tried to use AI once again to get a solution to the problem, the problem was in the version of tailwind, it had a bug. The solution was to try an older version of tailwind which let me because it was more stable than the current one, but I never thought that could be the problem. I had uninstalled it, installed node.js, I changed between versions and nothing worked, I tried to use yarn and it didn't work either, but the problem was the version of tailwind itself.
I added some small animations to the buttons
